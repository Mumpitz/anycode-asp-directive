Classic ASP directive for Jose Carreno's Astah-Plugin any&lt;code/>

Jose Carreno's Plugin is a powerful tool to create any kind of sourcecode
out of an UML-Diagram that is created in Astah.
Because i need to work with Classic ASP and VBScript, i try to create a directive
to be able to write asp/vbscript templates for the plugin
and so create a OOP usage with these antique Technologies.

At the Time of creation, i was using version 1.3.0_GA of the anycode Plugin.
